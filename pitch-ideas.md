## Memory Game

**1. Sumamry of Idea**

Goal of the game is to play 8x8 grid. Grid is made of 64 cards total, where each card will be a pair of another card. Once both cards are selected, they will be removed from the grid. User plays until all matches are made. 

**2. What problem or pain point does it solve? a. Keep it high level without going into too much detail. (3-4 sentences is enough)** 

Helps users practice short term memory. 

**3. Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition. What is the minimum required for you to present on your demo day?**

Card grid with functional cards and images with click listeners. 

Audrey notes: Could achieve all requirements.

## Find Friends For Your Dog

**1. Sumamry of Idea**

An application with three pages: a homepage, a dog friend page, and a testimonials page. On the dog friend page, users can browse dogs' profiles and look for a dog that would be a potential good fit as a friend for their dog. Users can add their own dog's information to the dog friend page, upload an image of their dog, and can contact the owners of potential good fit dogs.

**2. What problem or pain point does it solve? a. Keep it high level without going into too much detail. (3-4 sentences is enough)** 

Helps dog owners find local dog friends for their dogs.

**3. Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition. What is the minimum required for you to present on your demo day?**

Visible selection of dog profilies and an input feature for user to add their own dog's information. 


Audrey notes: manual data entry for the stock dogs. Could achieve all requirements.
